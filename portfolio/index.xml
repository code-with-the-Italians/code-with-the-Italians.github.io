This minimises context switching and improves productivity, while decreasing the impulse to continuously check your phone.
State of the project The app is in its very early dev stages. It&amp;rsquo;s likely to crash and burn at any time, it&amp;rsquo;s not optimised, it is not even an MVP (minimum viable product) for what it wants to be.</description></item></channel></rss>
