This menu will allow you to link your accounts 💪

# Step 3 - Subscribe to our Twitch channel

Now that your accounts are connected, head to our [Twitch page](https://twitch.codewiththeitalians.it) and click the "**
Subscribe**" button. In the menu that pops up you can specify that you want to subscribe using your Amazon Prime and we
are done!! 🎊💪

# Step 4 - Enjoy
