Bundel is a **digital wellbeing** Android app, helping you to focus by grouping up notifications and only releasing them in batches, at set times.
This minimises context switching and improves productivity, while decreasing the impulse to continuously check your phone.

## State of the project

The app is in its **very early dev stages**. It's likely to crash and burn at any time, it's not optimised, it is not even an MVP (minimum viable
product) for what it wants to be. It's a work in progress, and you can expect continued development and fixes, horrible temporary design, and all
those fun things we all get through when we're prototyping something. But it will get better! Nice things just need time.

## Why this app, why open source

This project was born out of an idea [Ivan Morgillo](https://github.com/hamen) and [Sebastiano Poggi](https://github.com/rock3r)
had: we wanted to learn using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), and maybe catch up on some other cool Android stuff.
But side projects never really get completed, and at the same time, just putting the code out there wouldn't really give much insight into the _how_
and _why_ things are done a certain way. Open source is a great way to sharing knowledge, and this being a side project for us, that was a given. But
making the sources available in and by itself isn't enough: you miss the context, get presented with a final solution to a largely unknown problem.
Just think how many times you've wondered why some code you were reading was done in that way and not in another!

So, we decided we'd share the _entire_ process. We stream ourselves, and some awesome guests, coding on the app, learning as we go, making mistakes
and fixing them. We've rather unoriginally named this project
**Code with the Italians**, as both Ivan and myself come from the country that brought you pizza (oh, and by the way, you're welcome!).

This app, Bundel, is our first in this live coding project of ours â€” who knows what will come next.

### I want to watch y'all crazies code

The good news is, it's really easy to do! To keep up to date with all that's happening, you should
[follow @codewiththeita](https://cwti.link/twitter) on Twitter. If Twitter isn't your thing â€” we understand! â€” we also make
announcements [on Telegram](https://cwti.link/telegram).

We live stream [on Twitch](https://cwti.link/twitch) and [on YouTube](https://cwti.link/yt). You can also find the whole archive of previous streams
over on YouTube.

We regularly stream ourselves coding on this app. We are _generally_ live at these times:

* Wednesdays at 18:30 CE(S)
  T ([other timezone?](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?hour=18&min=30&p1=215&p2=136&p3=tz_et&p4=tz_pt&p5=tz_ist&p6=tz_jst))
* Sundays at 17:00 CE(S)

Dates and times may vary though, so watch out for announcements. Or, you know, add
[this nifty iCal subscription](https://cwti.link/cal) to your calendar. You can find some instructions

## Acknowledgements

While ourselves, Ivan and Seb, are the two main authors of this app and the hosts of the streams, we need to acknowledge that we're standing on the
shoulders of giants.

We need to thank all our friendly guests, each bringing their invaluable experience and patience towards our bs to the streams and app. Thank you,
thank you, thank you! You folks are ðŸ’›

We also want to thank everyone that helped us behind the scenes with our oddly specific questions and doubts, saving us countless hours of swearing
and hacking away at tough problems.

Lastly, we thank everyone who's following us, watching us code, donating to the cause, and spreading the word. Y'all are the reason we're doing this!

<small>I know it says "lastly" right above this, but I feel we should also really thank the fine folks at Google Developers who have done us the
honour of [featuring us](https://devlibrary.withgoogle.com/products/android/repos/rock3r-Bundel)
in their brand new DevLibrary.</small>
